The solution lies in using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality, preventing implicit type coercion and ensuring accurate results.

```php
$value = '0';
if ($value === 0) {
  echo "Value is zero";
} else {
  echo "Value is not zero";
}
```
This corrected code will now correctly identify that the string '0' is not equal to the integer 0, producing the expected output.
